# Projects

This repository is a summary of the projects I've made, mainly for the [Integrated Master's in Informatics and Computing Engineering](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_curso_id=742) at FEUP.

## MIEIC FEUP

### PROG - Programming

This course had the goal of introducing us to basic programming concepts like types, input/output, control structures, data structures, etc. using the C/C++ language. More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=399883).

#### Project 1

The objective of this practical work is to develop two text processing programs and to create a data file that can be used as the basis for the development of several word games, such as scrabble, hidden words, crosswords, or others.
The development of the programs must be made in a modular way, so that some of the functions can be reused in other programs to be developed in the future.

The purpose of the first program is to "isolate" the entries (headwords) in a dictionary, in order to produce a list of valid words. 

The purpose of the second program is to implement and test some functions, that can be used in the future development of some word games, for doing common operations like: verify if a given word exists in a word list; verify if a given word can be made using a given set of letters or show all the words that can be made using a given set of letter.

#### Project 2

The objective of this practical work is to develop two programs, one to create a crosswords puzzle and save it, in a text file, the other to load a puzzle and let the user solve it. Students were expected to practice the development of programs in C++ language, following the "object-oriented" programming paradigm, selecting suitable data structures and algorithms for implementing the programs and taking advantage of the data structures and algorithms available in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
