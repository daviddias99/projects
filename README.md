### PROG - Programming

This course had the goal of introducing us to basic programming concepts like types, input/output, control structures, data structures, etc. using the C/C++ language. 

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=399883).

Both projects were developed with [Luís Cunha](https://github.com/luispcunha).

#### Project 1

**Description:**

The objective of this practical work is to develop two text processing programs and to create a data file that can be used as the basis for the development of several word games, such as scrabble, hidden words, crosswords, or others.
The development of the programs must be made in a modular way, so that some of the functions can be reused in other programs to be developed in the future.

The purpose of the first program is to "isolate" the entries (headwords) in a dictionary, in order to produce a list of valid words. 

The purpose of the second program is to implement and test some functions, that can be used in the future development of some word games, for doing common operations like: verify if a given word exists in a word list; verify if a given word can be made using a given set of letters or show all the words that can be made using a given set of letter.

**Grade:** *Ungraded*

#### Project 2

The objective of this practical work is to develop two programs, one to create a crosswords puzzle and save it, in a text file, the other to load a puzzle and let the user solve it. Students were expected to practice the development of programs in C++ language, following the "object-oriented" programming paradigm, selecting suitable data structures and algorithms for implementing the programs and taking advantage of the data structures and algorithms available in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).

**Grade:** 20/20

### AEDA - Algorithms and Data structures

In this course was focused on teaching us different algorithms (searching, sorting, ...) and data structures (lists, heaps, trees, sets, ...) and practicing their use using C++. We also learned about some concepts of UML, algorithm complexity (big-O notation).

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=399883).

Both projects were developed with [Luís Cunha](https://github.com/luispcunha) and [Gaspar Pinheiro](https://github.com/GasparPi).

#### Project 1

**Description:** The goal of the project was to create an information system for a chain of farmacies using the knowledge of algorithms and data structures gathered throughout the course. The system was to be created as a console application with CRUD operations and sorting/listing operations. We had the constraint of using only linear data structures (lists, arrays,...)

**Grade:** 19.4/20

[**Link to the project**](https://github.com/daviddias99/pharmacy-chain-feup-aeda)

#### Project 2

**Description:** This project was built on top of the first one and the goal was to alter the first solution to use non-linear data-structures (sets, trees,...).

**Grade:** 19.6/20

### LCOM - Computer Laboratory

In this course we were taught concepts of low level and device programming. We had weekly lab sessions where we experimented with different devices such as the timer, mouse, keyboard, videocard. For the final project we developed a game called **Typing Invaders** that used all the devices used in the labs and the RTC, and serial port. This course allowed me to gain knowledge on low level programming, more advanced C, and embedded systems.

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=419993).

The projects and labs were developed with [Luís Cunha](https://github.com/luispcunha).

#### Labs

**Description:** During the lab sessions we followed handouts that taught us how to program for difference I/O devices. The handouts were written in a way that incentivized self-learning and researching for achieving the desired outcomes

**Grade:** *Ungraded*

[**Link to the project**](https://github.com/daviddias99/low-level-programming-feup-lcom)

#### Project

**Description:** For the project we are to propose an application that would utilize all the devices and that showcased our C programming skills. We created a typing game called **Typing Invaders** that used all the devices. This was one of our first large projects that had no specification, so we were able to train our application design skills.

**Grade:** 19/20

### BDAD - Databases

In this course we learned concepts of database design (normal forms, functional dependencies, ...) and of relational database systems. We learned the best practices for designing databases, querying, triggers, ACID, etc.. For the project we were challenged to to design and implement a database using SQLite3 for a given context. We implemented a movie/show database inspired by IMDB.

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=419997).

The project was developed with Bernardo Santos ([bernas670](https://github.com/bernas670)) and Luís Cunha ([luispcunha](https://github.com/luispcunha))

#### Project

**Description:** The project was split into three checkpoint where we followed several steps to design and implement a database for a movie/show website like IMDB. For the first delivery we created the conceptual model, for the second delivery we refined the model and implemented it using SQLite3, and for the last delivery we created a series of queries and triggers. The project contains UML diagrams and SQL files for creating the database.

**Grade:** 17.6/20

#### Project

**Description:** For the project we were tasked with creating an algorithm for the concept of **ridesharing**. By gathering the departure and last arrival times of people in a **graph**, aswell as the existing cars the algorithm should attribute a path to each car to follow, as awell as the people to pickup. We divised an algorithm to do just that and implemented it.

**Grade:** 19.74/20

### CGRA - Computer Graphics

The computer graphics course was focused on teaching us the concepts of 3D modelling and 3D image generation. We learned concepts like lighting, shading, textures, shadow projection, colot, 3D surfaces, meshes, object modelling, rasterization, etc.. During the semester we did 2 projects that allowed us to apply this concepts in the creation of 3D scenes using WebGL.

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=419996).

Both projects were developed with [Luís Cunha](https://github.com/luispcunha).

#### Project 1

**Description:** The first project was focused on creating 3D objects and using those primitives to create more complex objects, while also taking into account concepts of lighting and texturing. In the end we had to compose a 3D scene using the created objects.

**Grade:** 19.1/20

[**Link to the project**](https://github.com/daviddias99/computer-graphics-feup-cgra)

#### Project 2

### PLOG - Logic Programming

In this course I was introduced a new programming paradigm: logic programming. This new approach presented itself as a challenge, but a very powerful skill in some situations. We applied the concepts of PROLOG first in a board game (with computer play) and then in a constraint solving context, for a construction team scheduling problem.

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=436444).

Both projects were developed with [Luís Cunha](https://github.com/luispcunha)

#### Project 1

**Description:** This project had us implement the game of Squex using PROLOG. The game was displayed in the console and is fully playable. This includes: listing available plays, checking for game over, executing plays, computer-AI, board evaluation. You can find the specification and final report in `project_1_squex/docs`. 

**Grade:** 19.4/20

[**Link to the project**](https://github.com/daviddias99/feup-plog)

#### Project 2

**Description:** For this project we used constraint programming (in PROLOG) to solve a scheduling problem envolving a construction team. The team had the objective of maximizing the profit given the available material resources, workers with different skills (and salaries), construction projects that required different skills and precedences between those skills. We had then to model the problem using prolog and use the constraint solving library to find admissible (ideally optimal solutions).


**Grade:** 19.7/20

### LAIG - Graphical Applications Laboratory

The LAIG course was a continuation from the CGRA course. In this course we learned more advanced concepts of 3D computer graphics and were able to apply them in more complex projects. We created more complex 3D objects, used keyframe animations and interfaced with other problems, namely a board game built in the PLOG (Logic programming) course.

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=436446).

Both projects were developed with [Bernardo Santos](https://github.com/bernas670)

#### Project 1

**Description:** Much similar to the projects done in the [CGRA course](https://github.com/daviddias99/computer-graphics-feup-cgra), this project had the goal of creating a scene composed of complex objects created from more primitive objects. For this project we also created a Triangle, Sphere, Bottomless cylinder and a Torus. We also created a file type, similar to LXS, which was used to describe the scene graph. We had also to deal with the concepts of lighting, textures, shadows, user I/O and materials. 

**Grade:** 19.8/20

[**Link to the project**](https://github.com/daviddias99/computer-graphics-feup-laig)

#### Project 2

**Description:** The second project built upon the first one and introduced new concepts such as keyframe animations, render to texture using GLSL shaders and 3D surfaces using NURBS.

**Grade:** 20/20

[**Link to the project**](https://github.com/daviddias99/computer-graphics-feup-laig)

#### Project 3

**Description:** For the last project we had the task of using the developped primitives and classes to create a 3D graphical interface for a board game developed in the PLOG course. We then built an interface for the game Squex. We had a scoreboard aswell as a timer, we also included a undo feature, and a game-movie feature which allowed the user to see all the plays done until that point. It was possible to play PvP or Player v Computer, with different levels of difficulty. We had to build the board and pieces of the game as well as animate the camera do follow the right players perspective (in case of PvP).

**Grade:** 19.4/20

### ESOF - Software Engineering

The ESOF course gave us a birds-eye view into the software development pipeline from start to finish. In it we learned different development processes (XP, Scrum, Waterfall...), architectural patterns, documentation (UML diagrams), testing (unit, integration, acceptance), requirements engineering (user stories), product design and marketing (vision, elevator pitch, ...) and project management.

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=436443).

Developed with Eduardo Ribeiro ([EduRibeiro00](https://github.com/EduRibeiro00)), José Gomes([JoeMGomes](https://github.com/JoeMGomes)) and Luís Cunha ([luispcunha](https://github.com/luispcunha))

#### Project

**Description:** As part of a large group of products built for the Open-CX conference, we built the Agenda Mobile App (AMA). This application used BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) technology to inform users that they might be passing near an interesting talk in the conference. The application allowed the user to mark their favourite events in the conference and to add their own events to the calendar.

**Grade:** 19.7/20

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=436445).

Both projects were developed with [Bernardo Santos](https://github.com/bernas670) and Luís Cunha ([luispcunha](https://github.com/luispcunha))

#### Project 1

**Description:** For the first project we had the task of creating a link-layer protocol that would be used by a test application (created by us) to transfer files between two computeres connected by a serial port. We were able to produce a program that implemented both protocols and that was resistant to errors(disconnecting and reconnecting serial port mid-transmission and introducing electric interference on the connection).

**Grade:** 18/20

[**Link to the project**](https://github.com/daviddias99/networking-feup-rcom)

#### Project 2

**Description:** For the second project we created a application that was able to download a file by implementing the FTP protocol (using sockets). We then used switches, routers and computers available in the network laboratory to create a small network architecture (with two VLANs, switches, NAT) where the application would be used.

**Grade:** 18/20
