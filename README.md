# Projects

This repository is a summary of the projects I've made, mainly for the [Integrated Master's in Informatics and Computing Engineering](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_curso_id=742) at FEUP.

## MIEIC FEUP

### PROG - Programming

This course had the goal of introducing us to basic programming concepts like types, input/output, control structures, data structures, etc. using the C/C++ language. 

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=399883).

Both projects were developed with [Luís Cunha](https://github.com/luispcunha).

#### Project 1

**Description:**

The objective of this practical work is to develop two text processing programs and to create a data file that can be used as the basis for the development of several word games, such as scrabble, hidden words, crosswords, or others.
The development of the programs must be made in a modular way, so that some of the functions can be reused in other programs to be developed in the future.

The purpose of the first program is to "isolate" the entries (headwords) in a dictionary, in order to produce a list of valid words. 

The purpose of the second program is to implement and test some functions, that can be used in the future development of some word games, for doing common operations like: verify if a given word exists in a word list; verify if a given word can be made using a given set of letters or show all the words that can be made using a given set of letter.

**Grade:** *Ungraded*

#### Project 2

The objective of this practical work is to develop two programs, one to create a crosswords puzzle and save it, in a text file, the other to load a puzzle and let the user solve it. Students were expected to practice the development of programs in C++ language, following the "object-oriented" programming paradigm, selecting suitable data structures and algorithms for implementing the programs and taking advantage of the data structures and algorithms available in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).

**Grade:** 20/20

### AEDA - Algorithms and Data structures

In this course was focused on teaching us different algorithms (searching, sorting, ...) and data structures (lists, heaps, trees, sets, ...) and practicing their use using C++. We also learned about some concepts of UML, algorithm complexity (big-O notation).

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=399883).

Both projects were developed with [Luís Cunha](https://github.com/luispcunha) and [Gaspar Pinheiro](https://github.com/GasparPi).

#### Project 1

**Description:** The goal of the project was to create an information system for a chain of farmacies using the knowledge of algorithms and data structures gathered throughout the course. The system was to be created as a console application with CRUD operations and sorting/listing operations. We had the constraint of using only linear data structures (lists, arrays,...)

**Grade:** 19.4/20

[**Link to the project**](https://github.com/daviddias99/pharmacy-chain-feup-aeda)

### LCOM - Computer Laboratory

In this course we were taught concepts of low level and device programming. We had weekly lab sessions where we experimented with different devices such as the timer, mouse, keyboard, videocard. For the final project we developed a game called **Typing Invaders** that used all the devices used in the labs and the RTC, and serial port. This course allowed me to gain knowledge on low level programming, more advanced C, and embedded systems.

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=419993).

The projects and labs were developed with [Luís Cunha](https://github.com/luispcunha).

#### Labs

**Description:** During the lab sessions we followed handouts that taught us how to program for difference I/O devices. The handouts were written in a way that incentivized self-learning and researching for achieving the desired outcomes

**Grade:** *Ungraded*

[**Link to the project**](https://github.com/daviddias99/low-level-programming-feup-lcom)

#### Project

**Description:** For the project we are to propose an application that would utilize all the devices and that showcased our C programming skills. We created a typing game called **Typing Invaders** that used all the devices.

### PLOG - Logic Programming

In this course I was introduced a new programming paradigm: logic programming. This new approach presented itself as a challenge, but a very powerful skill in some situations. We applied the concepts of PROLOG first in a board game (with computer play) and then in a constraint solving context, for a construction team scheduling problem.

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=436444).

Both projects were developed with [Luís Cunha](https://github.com/luispcunha)

#### Project 1

**Description:** This project had us implement the game of Squex using PROLOG. The game was displayed in the console and is fully playable. This includes: listing available plays, checking for game over, executing plays, computer-AI, board evaluation. You can find the specification and final report in `project_1_squex/docs`. 

**Grade:** 19.4/20

[**Link to the project**](https://github.com/daviddias99/feup-plog)

#### Project 2

**Description:** For this project we used constraint programming (in PROLOG) to solve a scheduling problem envolving a construction team. The team had the objective of maximizing the profit given the available material resources, workers with different skills (and salaries), construction projects that required different skills and precedences between those skills. We had then to model the problem using prolog and use the constraint solving library to find admissible (ideally optimal solutions).


**Grade:** 19.7/20

#### Project 1

**Description:** Much similar to the projects done in the [CGRA course](https://github.com/daviddias99/computer-graphics-feup-cgra), this project had the goal of creating a scene composed of complex objects created from more primitive objects. For this project we also created a Triangle, Sphere, Bottomless cylinder and a Torus. We also created a file type, similar to LXS, which was used to describe the scene graph. We had also to deal with the concepts of lighting, textures, shadows, user I/O and materials. 

**Grade:** 19.8/20

[**Link to the project**](https://github.com/daviddias99/computer-graphics-feup-laig)

**Grade:** 20/20

[**Link to the project**](https://github.com/daviddias99/computer-graphics-feup-laig)

#### Project 3

**Description:** For the last project we had the task of using the developped primitives and classes to create a 3D graphical interface for a board game developed in the PLOG course. We then built an interface for the game Squex. We had a scoreboard aswell as a timer, we also included a undo feature, and a game-movie feature which allowed the user to see all the plays done until that point. It was possible to play PvP or Player v Computer, with different levels of difficulty. We had to build the board and pieces of the game as well as animate the camera do follow the right players perspective (in case of PvP).

**Grade:** 19.4/20

#### Project

**Description:** The tool built serves as a compiler of .jmm files, written in the Java-- language, a subset of the Java language. All programs that are valid in the Java-- language are also valid in the Java language. 

This compiler implements all the steps of a compiler and generated machine code for the JVM: lexical and syntatic analysis, semantic analysis, code generation and several optimizations such as graph coloring. It also produced meaningful errors on the syntatic and semantic analysis like any other compiler. For more detailed specification visit the repository bellow.

### LDSO - Software Development Laboratory

In the LDSO course we were divided into teams of about 7/8 students and were tasked to do a software project for a real company. During the project we were to apply several aspects of real software project development: testing, commiting, branching, SCRUM practices, software quality, ...

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=281226).

#### Project

**Description:** The web-application was developed for the ZeroZero team at ZOS. The system's goal is to receive information about website traffic, and to provide information about possible ill-intended accesses such as web-scrapping bots and XSS/injection attempts. The analysis of these requests is made through an intuitive interface using ReactJS.

The backend service for receiving, analyzing and returning classifications for requests is made using Node/ExpressJS using PostgreSQL.

During this project I had the opportunity of contacting with an Agile Development environment with a team of 7 members. We also had to keep constant attemtion to different software development practices such as Unit Testing, good versioning practices (commits, branches), requirements engineering etc.. Throughout it, I sought to develop my leadership, teamwork, and organizational goals. Unfortunately, since the project was developed for ZeroZero I cannot show the source-code repository.

**Grade:** 20/20

### AIAD - Agents and Distributed Artificial Intelligence

In AIAD we learned about several aspects of multi-agent systems and agent-oriented software development. We learned different agent architectures and explored machine learning techniques such as Reinforcement learning. We also explored concepts of negotiation modelling and were given an introduction to game theory.

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=272771).

Both projects were developed with Manuel Coutinho ([ManelCoutinho](https://github.com/ManelCoutinho)) and Luís Cunha ([luispcunha](https://github.com/luispcunha))

#### Project 1

**Description:** For the first project we had the goal of proposing and implementing a multiagent system to simulate any real-life scenario using the JADE framework. We chose to create a 2nd hand marketplace where agents (sellers) would define a price for their products based on the market to try to sell them to other agents (Buyers). The sellers and buyers implemented different negotiation protocols and the sellers also implemented protocols that controlled how they would set their prices based on the market prices for their products.

Additionally, sellers had different probabillities of scamming the buyers, taking their money without giving them the product (which both gave them the chance to sell the product again and made it so that the buyers still needed to buy the product). This effected their reputation. Through this we also saught to measure how this factor would both influence the sellers (honesty vs greed) and how it affected the buyers (naiveness vs cautiousness).

**Grade:** 18/20

[**Link to the project**](https://github.com/daviddias99/mas-online-marketplace-feup-aiad)

#### Project 2

**Description:** For the second project we implemented on top of the first one to use the agent simulation toolkit Repast 3 to conduct large scale experiments on the implemented marketplace scenario. Through it we were able to conduct larger experiments and to study more aspects of the different parametrizations of the agents: price elasticity, scam factor, offer and counter offer strategies, seller picking.

**Grade:** 19.6/20

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=272905).

The project was developed with Eduardo Ribeiro ([EduRibeiro00](https://github.com/EduRibeiro00)), Luís Cunha ([luispcunha](https://github.com/luispcunha)) and Monika Stepien.

#### Project

**Description:** For this project we had the task of modelling a proposed shipping problem. We had to model import and export constreaints as well as other costs associated with travelling to find out the size of the fleet of two different types of boths that the fictious government of the proposed problem would have to acquire. The problem was solved using Simplex.

The report contains a detailed description of both the problem and our efforts at modelling and solving it. We also had the task of answering to some proposed questions that made us analyse our results and do sensitivity analisis to avoid solving the problem again to answer these questions.

### LGP - Project Management Laboratory

During LGP the a collection of programs at FEUP (MIEIC, MIEM, MESG, MESW) and from other faculties (Design @ FBAUP) are split into five companies. Each company must develop their company image and develop 4 projects, dividing the company into 4 teams. 

In LGP I was ellected the CEO of one of the companies ([Platypus Creative Solutions](https://platypus.pt/)), and integrated team B of the company as Design Manager. Has CEO I had the change of developping my communication skills and of dealing, delegating and facilitating communication between a company of about 50 students.

#### Project

**Description:**

Our product was developed by request of [Jumpseller](https://jumpseller.com/) and was to develop a GPS service similar to Uber Eats that would empower small to medium companies to create their own same-day delivery services. As such we built in top of the app jumpseller already has to create the courier support for that service (geo-location tracking, delivery picking, etc.)

We also implemented the backend service that would manage and store the locations of the couriers and display them on a map on the clients browser so tha they could live track the progress of their package.

**Grade:** ??/20

### VCOM - Computer Vision

During this course we started by getting an overview of the classical computer vision pipeline: image acquisition, processing and analysis of acquired images (filtering, segmentation, feature extraction), camera calibration, stereo etc.

Later we learned about machine learning concepts and approaches used in computer vision (Bag of words, SVMs, K-Means,...) and about deep learning (neural networks, CNNs, ...). We explored the usage of deep learning for different computer vision task: object classification, object detection (R-CNN, FAST/FASTER-RCNN, YOLO,...), image segmentation, instance detection, image generation (GANs), style transfer, domain translation, video analysis, ...

Both projects were developed with Bernardo Santos ([bernas670](https://github.com/bernas670)), Laura Majer ([m-ajer](https://github.com/luispcunha)) Luís Cunha ([luispcunha](https://github.com/m-ajer))

#### Project 1

**Description:** In this work we use a structured light technique to implement a system for 3D data acquisition, namely information about the height of objects, using household items. The technique consists of casting a pattern of light/shadow over the objects, capturing an image of said objects and, after detecting and extracting the pattern of the line, using the perspective projection matrix to compute the real world coordinates of the pattern points. With the image coordinate of those points and the projection matrix we are only able to obtain the line of sight of the image point, but by constraining the plane (light or shadow) to which the points of the pattern belong we are able to obtain the real world coordinates of each of the points of the pattern. We explore several computer vision techniques, including edge detection, data acquisition, and camera calibration. We are able to measure objects that do not have significant texture with a satisfactory precision, as well as introduce some degree of automation to the selection of suitable parameters for the algorithms used.

**Grade:** 18.5/20

#### Project 2

**Description:** In this work we explore some common tasks of modern Computer Vision. We apply classic machine learning algorithms (SVMs) with bag-of-words descriptors and state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to a multi-class classification problem of objects in a Museum (the Met). Since the dataset is highly unbalanced dataset, we explore techniques such as data augmentation. The architectures we use are then adapted to use in a multi-label classification problem.  Finally we explore the usage of CAMs (class activation mapping) to tackle a painting object detection task.

### CPAR - Parallel computing

In this course we learned about differnt aspects of parrallel computing and parallel machines. We learned about cache efficency, ways of parallelizing algorithms and ways of modelling and analyse the performance of parallel computer systems.

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=350413).

Both projects were developed with [Luís Cunha](https://github.com/luispcunha).

#### Project 1

**Description:** For this project we studied the performance of matrix multiplication algorithms. In order to study cache-efficiency the algorithm was altered to take this concepts into account by switching loop orders and by implementing blocking versions of the algorithm. We studied the behaviour of the algorithms for different matrix and block-sizes as well as different languages (in this case C/C++ and Java). In the C/C++ version we utilized the PAPI library in order to evaluate cache-misses to further confirm the hypothesis.

**Grade:** 17.7/20

#### Project 2

**Description:** For the second project we talked algorithm parallelization. To do this we utilized different algorithms: matrix multiplication and LU factorization. We utilized different frameworks to achieve parallelism: OpenMP (CPU), Sycl (CPU and GPU) and CUDA (baseline for GPU). We measured the performance of these algorithms for different matrix and block sizes.
