# Projects

This repository is a summary of the projects I've made, mainly for the [Integrated Master's in Informatics and Computing Engineering](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_curso_id=742) at FEUP.

## MIEIC FEUP

### PROG - Programming

This course had the goal of introducing us to basic programming concepts like types, input/output, control structures, data structures, etc. using the C/C++ language. 

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=399883).

Both projects were developed with [Luís Cunha](https://github.com/luispcunha).

#### Project 1

**Description:**

The objective of this practical work is to develop two text processing programs and to create a data file that can be used as the basis for the development of several word games, such as scrabble, hidden words, crosswords, or others.
The development of the programs must be made in a modular way, so that some of the functions can be reused in other programs to be developed in the future.

The purpose of the first program is to "isolate" the entries (headwords) in a dictionary, in order to produce a list of valid words. 

The purpose of the second program is to implement and test some functions, that can be used in the future development of some word games, for doing common operations like: verify if a given word exists in a word list; verify if a given word can be made using a given set of letters or show all the words that can be made using a given set of letter.

**Grade:** *Ungraded*

#### Project 2

The objective of this practical work is to develop two programs, one to create a crosswords puzzle and save it, in a text file, the other to load a puzzle and let the user solve it. Students were expected to practice the development of programs in C++ language, following the "object-oriented" programming paradigm, selecting suitable data structures and algorithms for implementing the programs and taking advantage of the data structures and algorithms available in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).

**Grade:** 20/20

### AEDA - Algorithms and Data structures

In this course was focused on teaching us different algorithms (searching, sorting, ...) and data structures (lists, heaps, trees, sets, ...) and practicing their use using C++. We also learned about some concepts of UML, algorithm complexity (big-O notation).

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=399883).

Both projects were developed with [Luís Cunha](https://github.com/luispcunha) and [Gaspar Pinheiro](https://github.com/GasparPi).

#### Project 1

**Description:** The goal of the project was to create an information system for a chain of farmacies using the knowledge of algorithms and data structures gathered throughout the course. The system was to be created as a console application with CRUD operations and sorting/listing operations. We had the constraint of using only linear data structures (lists, arrays,...)

**Grade:** 19.4/20

#### Project 2

**Description:** This project was built on top of the first one and the goal was to alter the first solution to use non-linear data-structures (sets, trees,...).

**Grade:** 19.6/20

### LCOM - Computer Laboratory

In this course we were taught concepts of low level and device programming. We had weekly lab sessions where we experimented with different devices such as the timer, mouse, keyboard, videocard. For the final project we developed a game called **Typing Invaders** that used all the devices used in the labs and the RTC, and serial port. This course allowed me to gain knowledge on low level programming, more advanced C, and embedded systems.

More info on the [course](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=419993).

The projects and labs were developed with [Luís Cunha](https://github.com/luispcunha).

#### Labs

**Description:** During the lab sessions we followed handouts that taught us how to program for difference I/O devices. The handouts were written in a way that incentivized self-learning and researching for achieving the desired outcomes

**Grade:** *Ungraded*

#### Project

**Description:** For the project we are to propose an application that would utilize all the devices and that showcased our C programming skills. We created a typing game called **Typing Invaders** that used all the devices. This was one of our first large projects that had no specification, so we were able to train our application design skills.

**Grade:** 19/20
